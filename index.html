  <h1><font size= "6" font face= "Comic Sans"> What is our Goal? </font></h1>
  
  <p><font size= "4" font face= "Comic Sans">   Bee Aware is trying to change the way people view the relationship between technology and the environment. Typically, when we think of technology, we see it as a destructive force that eradicates nature. However, this isn’t always true. In fact, many different people across the world have already started to use our new devices to aid Mother Nature, and ourselves simutaneously.</font></p>
  <p><font size= "4" font face= "Comic Sans">   For example, Singapore has created Supertrees, a type of technology that resembles a giant tree which is used to cleanse the air - similar to how a real tree would, but in a larger proportion. Another example is of envirorment tracking. In general, this refers to all of the ways technology has enabled us to keep tabs on the envirorments across the globe, and monitor any significant changes. This has been the main way we are tracking global warming. There are many, many other ways in which we can use modern inventions to improve the earth, and our website is designed to help others realize that.</font></p>
  
  <h2><font size = “6” font face = “Comic Sans”>The Movement of Educational Awareness </font></h2>
  
  <p><font size = “4” font face = “Comic Sans”> Bee Aware is part of the overall movement of envirormental awareness that is taking place all across the globe. Firstly, what is that movement? Well, envirormentalism is the philosophy that evokes the mentality in which us humans should take care of the Earth and the other creatures we share with it. So far, this idea has spread far and wide, and has been one of the most productive movements for a while now. It has gotten many envirormental protection laws passed, species preserved, and saved countless animals from extinction or abuse. Enviromental Awareness is one of the most simple yet powerful aspect of this philosophy, and by teaching our peers about it, we can began to fix some of the damage we have done to the enivirorment in the past.</font></p>
  
  <p><font size = “4” font face = “Comic Sans”> Sadly, one of the biggest opposers to enivormental awareness is technology. Its getting less and less uncommon to read articles about the looming future of a technology controlled society, in which there is no vegetation or animals in sight. However, this isn’t true. As mentioned in the previous article, there are many ways that technology is being used for the exact opposite purpose. </font></p>
  
  <h3> <font size = “6” font face = “Comic Sans“> Ways You can Help </font></h3>
  
  <p><font size = “4” font face= “Comic Sans”>It can seem pretty intimidating when thinking about the current state of our Earth, and at first, trying to make a difference can seem pretty futile. However, the truth is that any action can and will make a change. The first and best thing you can do is just be educated on the envirorment. Having a thorough understanding of the Earth can be kept by staying up to date on envirormental news and recent events, just like you would any other interesting subject. After that you can spread the word to other people in order to disseminate awareness. When you and your community have become more conscious of your surroundings, you may want to think about starting a small project or slightly changing your routine. They don’t have to be drastic differences, but small acts such as biking more, recycling, conserving your uses of energy, and having a small garden are all great ways that help the Earth and could make your own personal life better. </font></p>
